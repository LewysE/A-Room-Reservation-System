# Room-Reservation-System
My third year project in Swansea University

The main technology used in this project is the Google Calendar API which allowed me to create and manage all the various bookings between the python application and the web application.

The Python application will be run on a Raspbery Pi that shows the current booking status of a specific room. 

The ASP.NET web application allows anyone to see the booking status of all the available rooms. These rooms are sorted by first which campus they are on and then which building they are in. There is also an option to log in by using Auth0, once you have logged you are given the option to book a room. An admin has the options to create and delete new rooms.

For this project the web application was hosted on an localhost server.
